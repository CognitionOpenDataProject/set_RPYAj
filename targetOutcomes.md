For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 4.2.2. Reaction times. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Corrected RTs more than two standard deviations from the overall mean were excluded from the analysis (3.4% of the data). A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA with numbers direction (thumb-little finger, little finger-thumb) and hand posture (prone, supine) as within-subjects variables was carried out. A significant effect of numbers direction was found, F(1, 17) = 32.65, p < .001, η2p = .66, with faster RTs for the thumb-little finger mappings, i.e., mappings A and C (M = 508.5 ms, SD = 125), compared to little finger-thumb mappings, i.e., B and D (M = 563.2 ms, SD = 133.7) (see Fig. 2a). All the other effects were not significant.

> Next, we further explored differences in terms of ordinal position of the digits to be mapped (see Fig. 3 for RTs results as a function of mapping and of Arabic digits). In particular, since we were interested in investigating how numbers were classified depending on their position in the sequence, we performed a one-way ANOVA with Arabic digits as within-subjects variable (One, Two, Three, Four, Five). Results showed a main effect of Arabic digits on RTs, F(4, 68) = 26.23, p < .001, η2p = .61. Post-Hoc comparisons (Scheffè) revealed that digit One (M = 440.34 ms, SD = 81.19) was classified significantly faster than Two (M = 548.16 ms, SD = 93.36; p < .001), Three (M = 576.85 ms, SD = 79.95; p < .001), Four (M = 584.45 ms, SD = 104.2; p < .001) and Five (M = 529.27 ms, SD = 77.73; p < .01). Furthermore, digits Two (p < .01) and Five (p < .05) were classified significantly faster than Four.
